Task:	Write a CSS parser which will translate CSS rules written in a nested form into regular CSS rules that a browser can understand.

The nested form is the same as standard CSS except for the ability to put CSS rules inside other CSS rules by prefixing the selector by the "&" symbol. The following represents the base case:

	.standard_css_selector_1
	{
		/* standard css 1 */
	
		& .standard_css_selector_2
		{
			/* standard css 2 */
		}
	}

This should be translated to:

	.standard_css_selector_1
	{
		/* standard css 1 */
	}

	.standard_css_selector_1 .standard_css_selector_2
	{
		/* standard css 2 */
	}
	
Notes:

1. The parser should handle all types of selectors and must be able to match the included output.css file for input from the included input.css file.
2. Order the rules appear is not important.
3. Exactly matching the whitespace of the output is not necessary.
4. You can use any language and any libraries to write the parser.
5. List any libraries used with your submission so that we can duplicate the runtime environment on our machines.
6. You can assume that any CSS input is correct (i.e. there is no need to validate the CSS).
7. The space between the '&' symbol and the CSS selector is important. If there is no space between '&' and the first selector, there should be no space between the selectors in the resulting CSS rule. For example:

	a
	{
		&:hover, :visited
		{
			color: red;
		}
		
	}
	
should be translated to:

	a:hover, a:visited
	{
		color: red;
	}
